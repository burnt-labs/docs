# Zero to Dapp in 5 Minutes

Jump straight into building on XION with ready-made dapp templates that require little to no setup. These guides are designed to give developers an instant hands-on experience with building on XION, without needing to write or compile code, set up a local dev environment, configure  complex Treasury contracts, or build out a frontend.



## What’s Included in Each Guide

Each Dapp guide provides:

* **A working smart contract** — already instantiated and ready to use.
* **A configured Treasury contract** — already set up with:
  * **Fee Grants** to enable gasless transactions for users.
  * **Authorization Grants** that allow your frontend to execute transactions on the user’s behalf.
* **A prebuilt frontend** — all you need to do is deploy it (or run it locally) to interact with the smart contract.



Within minutes, you’ll go from nothing to a fully live, interactive dapp on XION, complete with a **Meta Account** login experience and transaction-ready frontend.
