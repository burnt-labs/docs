# Build a TODO App using the Collection-Document Storage Smart Contract

To reduce the need for custom contract development and accelerate Web2 to Web3 migrations, we've created a contract that provides a **collection/document based storage model**, inspired by Firebaseâ€™s Firestore. It supports structured JSON data storage using a flexible key-value format and an advanced permission model.

This solution is a major upgrade from the original `user_map` contract by enabling:

* **Namespaced storage**: Data is organized into logical **collections** and **documents**.
* **Permissioned access**: Fine-grained control over who can **`create`**, **`update`**, `delete`, and `read` documents.
* **Role-based security**: Support for roles like "creator", "admin", and any custom roles.
* **Batch operations**: Write multiple documents in a single transaction.



## Todo App Data Structure

This todo app interacts with the DocuStore smart contract by organizing data into three main collections. Each collection stores structured documents with user-specific data.

### Todos Collection

```javascript
interface Todo {
  id: string;
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
  createdAt: number;
}
```

Each document in the `todos` collection represents an individual task. It includes basic task details, and timestamps.

### Profiles Collection

```javascript
interface Profile {
  displayName: string;
  bio: string;
  avatar: string;
  socialLinks: {
    twitter?: string;
    github?: string;
    website?: string;
  };
}
```

The `profile` collection stores public facing user profile data such as name, bio, and social media links.

### Settings Collection

```javascript
interface Settings {
  darkMode: boolean;
  notifications: boolean;
  language: string;
  timezone: string;
}
```

The `settings` collection holds user preferences for customizing the application experience, including UI theme, notification toggles, and localization options.



## Building the Frontend <a href="#building-the-frontend" id="building-the-frontend"></a>

We've created a frontend which is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application built to interact with the **DocuStore** smart contract that can be downloaded at [https://github.com/burnt-labs/todo-app-frontend](https://github.com/burnt-labs/todo-app-frontend). It showcases how users can connect their wallets, create todo records, update their profile, app settings and query their data.

### Manual Installation <a href="#manual-installation" id="manual-installation"></a>

1. You will first need to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/burnt-labs/todo-app-frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd todo-app-frontend
npm install
```

3. Copy the **`.env.example`** file and name it **`.env.local`** and set the values with the information below:

```javascript
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="xion1svpts9q2ml4ahgc4tuu95w8cqzv988s6mf5mupt5kt56gvdnklks9hzar4"
NEXT_PUBLIC_TREASURY_ADDRESS="xion1aza0jdzfc7g0u64k8qcvcxfppll0cjeer56k38vpshe3p26q5kzswpywp9"
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL="https://rpc.xion-testnet-2.burnt.com:443"
NEXT_PUBLIC_REST_URL="https://api.xion-testnet-2.burnt.com"
```

| Variable                        | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NEXT\_PUBLIC\_TREASURY\_ADDRESS | Treasury contract instance used for gasless transactions and grantz authorization to execute transactions via the DocuStore smart contract instance on behalf of users. |
| NEXT\_PUBLIC\_CONTRACT\_ADDRESS | Address of the DocuStore smart contract instance.                                                                                                                       |
| NEXT\_PUBLIC\_RPC\_URL          | RPC endpoint for Xion (default: `https://rpc.xion-testnet-2.burnt.com:443`)                                                                                             |
| NEXT\_PUBLIC\_REST\_URL         | REST endpoint for Xion (default: `https://api.xion-testnet-2.burnt.com`)                                                                                                |



3. Build and start the application:

```
npm run dev
```

You can now access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.
