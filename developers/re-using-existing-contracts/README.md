# Re-using Existing Contracts

Leveraging existing, **battle-tested** smart contracts can significantly accelerate development, reduce costs, and improve security. This section highlights a curated list of pre-built CosmWasm contracts that can be deployed out-of-the-box or integrated as modules within your custom smart contracts.

To ensure a secure and streamlined path to Mainnet approval, developers are strongly encouraged to adopt audited, widely used contracts where possible. Rather than building from scratch, using trusted components as building blocks minimizes risk, cuts audit expenses, and increases the likelihood of passing governance reviews.



## **Why Choose Audited & Proven Contracts?**

### **Security & Reliability**

Audited contracts offer vetted security, having undergone expert review to uncover and fix vulnerabilities. Battle-tested contracts offer proven reliability, having been extensively used and validated by the community over time.

A prime example is the [**cw-plus**](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus) collection of contracts. The cw-plus repository continues to serve as a valuable reference point, directing developers to these essential, community-proven contract implementations.

### **Lower Costs & Faster Time to Market**

Pre-audited contracts drastically reduce audit scope and cost, as much of the core logic has already been verified. This accelerates the approval process for Mainnet deployment, where proven security is a major factor.

Additionally, these contracts provide production-ready functionality, allowing developers to focus on building differentiated features rather than reinventing the wheel. The `cw-plus` suite illustrates this perfectly, offering well-maintained, standardized modules refined through extensive adoption.



## Building for Mainnet

We have also put together guides on how to [**Build to get your Apps on Mainnet**](https://docs.burnt.com/xion/developers/building-for-mainnet). This section outlines the key differences between **Testnet** and **Mainnet**, the requirements for deployment, and best practices to ensure your contracts are approved and adopted by the community. We recommend reading through the contents of this section.
