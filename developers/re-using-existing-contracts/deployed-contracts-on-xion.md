# Deployed Contracts on XION

XION provides a growing library of contracts that are already deployed and available on both **Mainnet** and **Testnet**. This makes it easy for developers to instantiate existing contracts instead of deploying new ones. Many of these contracts are pre-audited or have been around so long that they are considered battle tested.



### What You'll Find

You can view a full list of these deployed contracts and their **code IDs** in the [**burnt-labs/contracts**](https://github.com/burnt-labs/contracts) repository. If you go to the [**Readme**](https://github.com/burnt-labs/contracts/blob/main/README.md) file under the "**Active Contracts**" section you will see a table listing:

* **Contract name**
* **Descriotion** of the contract
* The **release tag** on github of the source code that was deployed on-chain
* The creators of the smart contract
* **Code ID** for **Mainnet** and **Testnet**
* The **governance proposal** that was executed to deploy the contract



**Before using a contract on Mainnet, you should first test its equivalent on Testnet.** Ensure your integration works correctly before submitting a governance proposal for Mainnet deployment. There should always be a respective **Code ID** of each contract deployment on **Testnet** that you can instantiate and test out.
