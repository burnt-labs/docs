# Marketplace

NFT **marketplaces** are smart contracts that allow users to **buy, sell, and list NFTs** in a decentralized way. They function as digital storefronts where NFTs can be exchanged using smart contract logic, without the need for a centralized intermediary.

In the context of the **XION ecosystem**, marketplaces are critical because:

* They **enable discovery and liquidity** for NFTs
* They **automate trustless transactions** using smart contracts
* They **support royalty enforcement**, helping creators earn on secondary sales
* They offer **customization and access control**, allowing developers to tailor the buying/selling experience

By deploying a marketplace contract, developers can either create a **permissionless open market** for many collections or a **curated shop** for a single NFT series.
