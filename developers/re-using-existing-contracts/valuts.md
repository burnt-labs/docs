# Valuts

In Web3 and DeFi, **vaults** are smart contracts designed to **hold and manage assets** according to a predefined strategy or set of rules. They serve as **automated safes** for usersâ€™ funds, allowing for more complex behaviours such as yield generation, trading, hedging, time-locking, or role-based access.

Vaults can be:

* **Permissioned** â€“ where only specific users or contracts can interact
* **Governed** â€“ controlled by DAOs or multisigs for security and flexibility
