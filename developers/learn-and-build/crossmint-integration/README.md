# Crossmint Integration

XION has partnered with [Crossmint](https://www.crossmint.com) to bring seamless NFT purchasing experiences to users via credit card and crypt payments. Crossmint's powerful Web3 checkout infrastructure now supports XION, allowing developers to create apps where users can buy NFTs using familiar, Web2-native payment methods, no wallets or crypto required.

This section of the docs will guide you through:

* How the Crossmint integration works with XION
* Setting up your project with Crossmint APIs and SDKs
* A test frontend example you can use or fork
* Additional resources to keep in mind
