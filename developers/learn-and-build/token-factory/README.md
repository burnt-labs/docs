# Token Factory

When creating tokens on XION, developers have two main options: [**CW20 smart contracts**](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/blob/main/packages/cw20/README.md) or the [**Token Factory module**](https://github.com/strangelove-ventures/tokenfactory). While CW20 has been widely used in the Cosmos ecosystem, Token Factory provides a **simpler,** more **efficient,** and **scalable** alternative.



## **CW20 Token Standard**

The CW20 token standard is analogous to Ethereum's ERC20 standard and is widely adopted within the Cosmos ecosystem. Implementing a CW20 token involves several key considerations:

* **Deployment and Maintenance**: Developers must deploy and instantiate a CW20 contract for the token. This process could require ongoing maintenance, including updates and potential redeployments to address issues or implement enhancements.
* **Integration Effort**: Integrating CW20 tokens into other contracts or apps necessitates additional development work to ensure compatibility and seamless interaction.
* **IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) Compatibility**: Enabling IBC transfers for CW20 tokens requires additional contracts, adding complexity to cross-chain interactions.



## **Token Factory Module**

The Token Factory module is a built-in feature of the Xion ecosystem, providing a more streamlined approach to token creation and management. Key features include:

* **Permissionless Token Creation**: Any account can create a new native token, similar to the Xion native token managed by the bank module. Tokens are uniquely identified using the format `factory/{creator address}/{subdenom}`, preventing name collisions.
* **Administrative Control**: The original creator of a token is granted "admin" privileges, allowing them to:
  * **Mint**: Issue new tokens to any account.
  * **Burn**: Remove tokens from circulation from any account.
  * **Admin Management**: Change the admin, including the option to set it to an empty string (`""`), relinquishing administrative control.



## **Comparison: Token Factory vs. CW20 Tokens**

While both methods enable token creation, the Token Factory module offers several advantages over the CW20 standard:

* **Simplicity and Efficiency**: Creating and managing tokens via the Token Factory is more straightforward, eliminating the need for deploying and maintaining separate smart contracts for  tokens.
* **Native Integration**: Tokens created through the Token Factory are natively integrated into the blockchain's bank module, facilitating easier management and interaction within the ecosystem.
* **IBC Compatibility**: Token Factory tokens are inherently compatible with IBC, simplifying cross-chain transfers without the need for additional contracts or conversion mechanisms.

Here's a detailed comparison between the CW20 token standard and the Token Factory module:

| Feature                          | CW20 Tokens (Smart Contracts)                                                                          | Token Factory (Native Tokens)                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deployment Complexity**        | Requires writing, deploying, and maintaining a **separate smart contract** for token creation.         | Tokens are created via a simple transaction utilizing the bank module — **no smart contract needed**.                         |
| **Gas Costs**                    | Every interaction (mint, transfer, burn) requires executing a smart contract, **increasing gas fees**. | Uses **native blockchain functions**, making transactions significantly **cheaper and more efficient**.                       |
| **Security**                     | Smart contracts can contain **bugs and vulnerabilities**, requiring **audits and ongoing monitoring**. | Tokens are **natively managed** by the blockchain’s bank module, reducing attack vectors and eliminating the need for audits. |
| **Integration with apps**       | Developers must **manually integrate** the smart contract logic into their app, adding complexity.    | Tokens are **supported** by wallets, explorers, and apps using the standard bank module.                                     |
| **IBC Compatibility**            | Requires an **additional CW20-ICS20 wrapper contract** to enable IBC transfers.                        | Tokens are **natively IBC-compatible**, allowing **seamless cross-chain transfers** without extra contracts.                  |
| **Upgradeability & Maintenance** | Upgrading requires **deploying a new contract** and migrating balances—**tedious and error-prone**.    | No maintenance required—**tokens don’t need upgrades** as they are managed by the bank module.                                |

While the CW20 token standard provides a robust framework for token creation, the Token Factory module offers a more efficient and streamlined alternative, particularly in terms of management simplicity and cross-chain compatibility.
