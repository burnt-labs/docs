# Websockets

A WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides two way communication channels over a single TCP connection between a client and server. This means that once a WebSocket connection is established, both the client and server can send and receive data simultaneously without the need for repeated HTTP requests.



## **Why Use WebSockets?**

WebSockets are especially valuable in situations where real-time updates are essential. Below are some typical use cases:

* **Blockchain and dApps**: WebSockets allow for real-time tracking of blockchain activities, such as new transactions, changes in contract states, or validator updates.
* **Live Notifications**: Applications can instantly send notifications to users, like alerts for new messages or important updates.
* **Collaborative Tools**: Real-time collaboration platforms, such as shared document editors, depend on WebSockets to synchronize changes among users.
* **Gaming and Streaming**: WebSockets are utilized to provide real-time game state updates or to stream live video and audio content.

In the context of XION, WebSockets enable developers to subscribe to blockchain events and receive instant updates, facilitating the development of dynamic and interactive dApps.
