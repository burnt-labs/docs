# Smart Contract Audits: Process, Costs & Support

Security is a top priority on Xion **Mainnet**, and **auditing your smart contract is a recommended step** before submitting it for governance approval. This ensures that only **secure, reliable, and battle-tested** contracts are deployed on-chain, protecting users and the ecosystem.



## **Why Are Audits Required?**

Audits are essential in smart contract development to enhance security, credibility, and compliance. They help identify and mitigate vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers, ensuring the contract is robust and secure.

The community is also more likely to approve audited contracts, increasing their chances of adoption in the XION ecosystem. Additionally, well-audited contracts build trust among users and developers, encouraging wider adoption. Finally, audits help ensure that the contract adheres to security standards and best practices, reducing risks and improving overall reliability.



## **The Smart Contract Audit Process**

The audit process typically follows these key stages to ensure security and reliability:

### **Preliminary Self-Review**

* Use **battle-tested contracts** instead of writing everything from scratch.
* Conduct **internal testing** to check for basic logic errors.
* Use **static analysis tools** to scan for vulnerabilities.

### **Code Review & Community Feedback**

* Share your contract with the **Xion developer community** for informal peer review.
* Deploy and test on **Xion Testnet** to refine performance and security.
* Get feedback from experienced developers before seeking a professional audit.

### **Professional Audit**

* Choose an experienced **smart contract auditing firm.**
* Provide documentation, unit tests, and expected behaviours for better review.
* Fix any security issues found and **get a re-audit** if necessary.



## **How Much Does a Smart Contract Audit Cost?**

The cost of a smart contract audit depends on several factors, including the complexity, length, and urgency of the contract(s). More intricate contracts with advanced functionality typically require more extensive reviews, increasing the overall cost.

**Tip:** Using pre-audited contracts can significantly reduce the amount of new code that needs to be reviewed, helping to lower audit expenses.
