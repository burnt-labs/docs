# Deploying to Xion Mainnet

Xion **Mainnet** is a **permissioned** environment designed to host secure and community approved decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike **Testnet**, deploying to **Mainnet** requires governance approval to ensure only **trusted, high-quality** contracts are stored on-chain.

This section will guide you through the **Mainnet deployment process**, including governance requirements, security best practices, and contract storage policies.



## **Key Differences Between Testnet & Mainnet**

| Feature             | Testnet                      | Mainnet                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Deployment**      | Open to all (permissionless) | Requires governance approval |
| **Contract Audits** | Optional but recommended     | **Mandatory** for approval   |
| **Security**        | Experimental environment     | High-security environment    |
| **Real Assets**     | No (test tokens)             | Yes (real value at stake)    |



## **Mainnet Deployment Steps**

To deploy a contract on **Mainnet**, developers must:

* **Thoroughly test your contract(s) on Testnet.**
* **Undergo a security audit** to validate the contract's safety.
* **Create a** [**Signaling Proposal**](https://discourse.xion.burnt.com/c/govpros/mainnet-contract-deployments/6) and inform the community and encourage them to give feedback
* **Submit a** [**governance proposal**](https://staking.burnt.com/governance) for community approval.
* **Once approved, your contract will be stored on Mainnet.**
