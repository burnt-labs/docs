# Xion Testnet: Your Development Playground

The **Xion Testnet** is a permissionless environment designed for developers to build, test, and refine their decentralized applications (dApps) before deploying to **Mainnet**. It allows you to safely experiment with smart contracts, receive community feedback, and ensure your dApp is secure and functional.



## **Why Use Testnet?**

Testnet serves as a critical step in the development process, offering:

* **Permissionless Deployment** – No governance approval is required, allowing developers to freely deploy and test their contracts.
* **Risk-Free Testing** – Transactions and contract interactions use test tokens, meaning no real assets are at stake.
* **Community Feedback** – Engaging users early helps refine dApps before Mainnet launch.
* **Pre-Mainnet Validation** – Identifying and fixing issues beforehand increases the chances of passing Mainnet governance.



## **Testnet Resources**

To begin building on Xion's Testnet, you'll need these essential resources. First, set up your development environment by following our [Complete Environment Setup Guide](https://docs.burnt.com/xion/developers/featured-guides/setup-local-environment) to configure everything for smart contract development and chain interaction.

You'll need XION test tokens to interact with the network. These are free and available through the [Testnet Faucet](https://docs.burnt.com/xion/developers/section-overview/xion-testnet). Once funded, you can connect to the Testnet using public endpoints to execute transactions and queries. Find all [Endpoint Details Here](https://docs.burnt.com/xion/developers/section-overview/public-endpoints-and-resources#testnet-2).

To monitor activity, use our [Block Explorers](https://docs.burnt.com/xion/developers/section-overview/block-explorers) to track accounts, transactions, proposals and validators. For cross-chain functionality, Xion supports Inter-Blockchain Communication. Explore connected chains and assets through our [IBC Channels ](https://docs.burnt.com/xion/developers/section-overview/ibc-denoms-on-xion-networks)section.
