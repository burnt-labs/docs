# Building for Mainnet

The Xion Foundation aims to offer developers a clear and structured pathway for deploying secure and reliable decentralized applications (dApps). This section outlines the key differences between **Testnet** and **Mainnet**, the requirements for deployment, and best practices to ensure your contracts are approved and adopted by the community.



## **Testnet: A Space for Development & Refinement**

The **Xion Testnet** is a **permissionless** environment where developers can deploy and refine their contracts without restrictions. We encourage teams to:

* **Test and iterate** their contracts before considering Mainnet deployment.
* **Engage with the community** for feedback, allowing real users to test their dApps and identify potential improvements.
* **Ensure stability and security** by rigorously testing different scenarios and edge cases.

By leveraging Testnet, developers can refine their dApps to the highest standards before moving to Mainnet.



## **Mainnet: A Secure & Permissioned Environment**

Unlike **Testnet**, the **Xion Mainnet is permissioned**, meaning contracts cannot be deployed freely. Instead, contracts must go through a [**governance proposal process**](../section-overview/governance/deploy-contract-mainnet.md), where the Xion community reviews and votes on whether a contract should be stored on-chain.

To protect users and maintain the security of the network, **audited contracts** have the highest chance of being considered for approval. This ensures that **Mainnet** hosts only **secure and reliable** dApps.

### **Governance & Audit Requirements**

To increase the chances of passing governance and deploying on Mainnet, developers should:

1. **Use existing, battle-tested contracts** – Where possible, developers should build on top of widely used and audited contracts to simplify the review process.
2. **Engage with the community** – Early discussions with the community can help identify concerns and improve the likelihood of governance approval.
3. **Conduct a security audit** – A professional third-party audit is highly recommended to ensure the contract has no vulnerabilities.
4. **Follow the governance process** – Refer to the [official guidelines](../section-overview/governance/deploy-contract-mainnet.md) for detailed steps.
