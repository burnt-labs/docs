# Interacting with Xion Chain using Xion Daemon

`xiond` is the command-line interface (CLI) daemon for interacting with the **Xion blockchain**. It allows users to manage accounts, send transactions, query blockchain data, and operate validator nodes.&#x20;



## **Prerequisites**

Before proceeding with this guide, ensure that `xiond` is installed on your system. Follow the installation steps outlined in the [Installation Prerequisites](https://docs.burnt.com/xion/developers/featured-guides/setup-local-environment/installation-prerequisites-setup-local-environment#xiond) guide.

To verify your installation, run:

```
xiond
```

If installed correctly, you should see the following output:

```
xion daemon (server)

Usage:
  xiond [command]

  start                 Run the full node
  status                Query remote node for status
  tx                    Transactions subcommands
  version               Print the application binary version information

Flags:
  -h, --help                help for xiond
      --home string         directory for config and data (default "/Users/adrianthompson/.xiond")
      --log_format string   The logging format (json|plain) (default "plain")
      --log_level string    The logging level (trace|debug|info|warn|error|fatal|panic|disabled or '*:<level>,<key>:<level>') (default "info")
      --log_no_color        Disable colored logs
      --trace               print out full stack trace on errors

Use "xiond [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

This output displays the available commands within `xiond`. Each command may include additional subcommands. To get more details about a specific command, use the `--help` flag.



## Generate an account

To execute transactions on-chain, you need at least one funded account. This section will guide you through the process of creating and funding an account using `xiond`.

### Generate an Account Key Pair

To interact with the XION blockchain, you need a cryptographic key pair, consisting of a **public key** and a **private key**. The public key is used to derive your address, while the private key is required to sign transactions.

#### **Generate a New Key Pair**

Use the following command to create a new key pair and add it to your local key store:

```sh
xiond keys add <keyname>
```

Replace `<keyname>` with a name of your choice for easy reference.

#### **Retrieve Public Key**

If you have already generated a key pair and need to retrieve its public key, use the following command:

```sh
xiond keys show <keyname>
```

Replace `<keyname>` with the name of your key to display its public key.



### Fund Your Account

Your account is not fully registered on-chain until it is involved in a transaction. The easiest way to achieve this is by **funding your account**, which allows it to interact with the network.

#### **Request Testnet Tokens**

You can obtain testnet tokens through one of the following methods:

* **Discord Faucet**: Request tokens by using the faucet bot in the **XION Discord**.
* **Faucet Web Page**: Visit the [XION Faucet](https://faucet.xion.burnt.com/) and follow the instructions to receive testnet tokens.

For more details on accessing testnet tokens, see our [Faucet Page](https://docs.burnt.com/xion/developers/section-overview/xion-testnet).

#### **Mainnet Tokens**

If youâ€™re deploying contracts on **XION Mainnet**, you can acquire XION tokens through various **decentralized** and **centralized exchanges**.



## **Connecting to Different Xion Chain Instances**

By default, `xiond` uses a local network node for executing transactions and queries. However, if you need to connect to a different chain, such as a public testnet or mainnet, you must specify the appropriate **chain ID** and **node URL**.



### **Finding Chain IDs and Public Nodes**

You can find the **chain IDs** for all Xion chains, along with available public RPC nodes, in the [Public Endpoints and Resources](https://docs.burnt.com/xion/developers/section-overview/public-endpoints-and-resources) section of the documentation.



### **Executing Transactions**

To interact with a different Xion blockchain for sending transactions, you need to explicitly set:

* The **chain ID** using the `--chain-id` flag
* The **node URL** using the `--node` flag

#### **Example: Sending tokens to an account**

```sh
xiond tx bank send <your-wallet> <recipient-address> <amount>uxion \
  --chain-id <target-chain-id> \
  --node <node-url> \
  --from <your-wallet> \
  --gas-prices 0.025uxion \
  --gas auto \
  --gas-adjustment 1.3 \
  -y
```

* Replace `<target-chain-id>` with the appropriate chain ID.
* Replace `<node-url>` with the RPC endpoint of the target chain.

#### Possible Output

```
gas estimate: 70320
code: 0
codespace: ""
data: ""
events: []
gas_used: "0"
gas_wanted: "0"
height: "0"
info: ""
logs: []
raw_log: ""
timestamp: ""
tx: null
txhash: 20511E66575DCECF23EBFF7D848DA75DA88A474CD17089C5225C1D04C9561A57
```

### **Executing Queries**

For queries, you only need to set the `--node` flag, as queries do not require the `--chain-id` parameter.

#### **Example: Querying Account Balance**

```sh
xiond query bank balances <wallet-address> --node <node-url>
```

#### Possible Output

```
balances:
- amount: "1223782"
  denom: uxion
pagination:
  total: "1"
```
