# Your First DApp

Decentralized applications (apps) rely on both **frontend** and **backend** components to provide smooth user experiences. The **frontend** interacts with users via web or mobile interfaces, while the **backend**, powered by smart contracts, executes transactions and business logic on the blockchain.

XION enhances this by enabling **meta accounts** with **gasless transactions**, ensuring users can interact with apps just like traditional web apps, without having to pay gas fees. Developers can build **intuitive frontends** that abstract blockchain complexities, improving usability and adoption.
