# Account Abstraction for RESTful API with Backend Session

In this guide, we will walk through building a RESTful API app with session management using the [Abstraxion Backend library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@burnt-labs/abstraxion-backend), demonstrating how to create a web2 user experience without any web3 interactive behavior in frontend. It also includes the Abstraxion account and gasless transaction experience for users, but all the blockchain related implementation will be handled in the backend.

To better understand Account Abstraction you can visit the[Introduction to Account Abstraction](https://docs.burnt.com/xion/developers/learn/intro-to-account-abstraction) page.

A fully functional demo of this app is also available in the [Xion.js](https://github.com/burnt-labs/xion.js/tree/main/apps/backend-session) repository.
