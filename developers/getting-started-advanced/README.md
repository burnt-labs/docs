# Getting Started (Advanced)

The XION ecosystem is built to support both beginner-friendly onboarding and advanced development workflows. While the[ Zero to App in 5 Minutes guides](https://docs.burnt.com/xion/developers/xion-quick-start/zero-to-dapp-in-5-minutes) are great for spinning up a basic App quickly, we understand that some developers need more flexibility and control.

This section was created specifically for:

* Developers who need to **write their own CosmWasm smart contracts** from scratch.
* Teams building **custom frontends** that deeply integrate with the XION blockchain.
