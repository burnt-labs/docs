# Create a Gas-less User Experience

**The recommended method to create a gas-less experience for your users is using the Treasury Contracts (**[**read here**](../treasury-contracts.md)**).**&#x20;

Fee Granting ([read here](fee-granting.md))  is an alternative method, but is **not recommended** since it would require the dApp to handle the setup and allowance. This method allows for the same experience if you don't want to use Treasury Contract method for your application but note that the recommended method ([Treasury Contracts](../treasury-contracts.md)) executes the same steps under the hood
