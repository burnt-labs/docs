# Web2 vs Web3 App Architecture: A Comparison

As a developer transitioning from Web2 to Web3, one of the most important things to understand is  how the application architecture changes.

In Web2, applications are typically built using centralized infrastructure. Backend servers handle business logic, authentication, and data storage, while the frontend communicates with these servers through calling files that exist on the server(s). Developers have full control over the infrastructure and data, and security is managed through centralized access controls.

In contrast, Web3 applications follow a decentralized architecture. Business logic is moved into **smart contracts** that run on the blockchain. Data is stored **on-chain**, and users authenticate using **wallets** instead of traditional login systems. The frontend plays a much larger role, directly interacting with smart contracts and blockchain APIs without relying on a centralized backend.

Additionally, in Web3 **every interaction with the blockchain incurs a transaction fee**, known as **gas**. This fee is required to execute smart contract logic, store data, or trigger on-chain changes, adding an economic layer to app interactions that developers must account for.

The table below outlines how the core components of a Web2 app compare to those in a Web3 app built on XION:

| Component           | Web2 Architecture             | Web3 Architecture (on XION)                          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend Logic       | Laravel, Express.js, Django   | CosmWasm Smart Contracts                             |
| Database            | MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB    | On-chain Contract State                              |
| Auth                | Email/Password, OAuth         | Wallet-based Authentication, Smart Contract Accounts |
| Frontend            | React, Vue, Ember.js          | Vue, React, `xion.js`, `cosmjs`                      |
| Hosting             | Nginx, Heroku, AWS            | Vercel, Netlify, IPFS                                |
| Business Logic      | Runs server-side              | Runs in smart contracts                              |
| API Layer           | REST, GraphQL                 | RPC, gRPC, API services via blockchain nodes         |
| User Identity       | Centralized user records      | Wallet addresses + signatures                        |
| Data Privacy        | Server-side protected data    | Public, on-chain state                               |
| Cost of Interaction | Free to users or subscription | User or app pays gas per blockchain tx              |



## Architectural Mindset Shift

Shifting from **Web2** to **Web3** development, especially on XION, requires a new way of thinking about **infrastructure**, **data**, **trust**, and **control**.

### Web2

* **You control everything**: Servers, databases, and user accounts are all managed by you or your team.
* **Data is private by default**: User and application data is stored in centralized, access-controlled databases.
* **Trust is enforced by infrastructure**: Firewalls, authentication systems, and permission models are used to establish and maintain security.
* **Users expect free or subscription-based access**: Most Web2 applications are free to use (ad-supported) or follow a subscription-based model where users pay for premium features or services. Users generally aren’t charged per interaction.

### Web3 (on XION)

* **The blockchain becomes your backend**: Your application logic is deployed as smart contracts on the XION network, not hosted on private servers.
* **Data is public by default**: All state is stored on-chain and is accessible to anyone, ensuring transparency and auditability.
* **Users are in control**: There are no centralized accounts, users manage their own wallets and sign transactions to interact with your app.
* **Logic is deterministic and immutable**: Smart contracts stores the business logic of your app and run exactly as written. Changes require deliberate migrations/upgrades.
* **Each interaction has a cost**: All meaningful changes to blockchain state require **gas**, paid either by the user or the app.



***

As you transition to building on XION, your focus shifts away from traditional backend services and toward designing smart contracts that define the core logic of your application. You no longer need to manage user accounts or credentials, wallets handle authentication, authorization and identity natively. The frontend takes on a more central role, often interacting directly with smart contracts to trigger application logic. Every interaction with the blockchain incurs a gas fee and results in an immutable state change once confirmed. Because of this, testing, versioning, and managing contract migrations become essential skills for maintaining and evolving your app over time.

Transitioning from Web2 to Web3 development requires more than new tools, it requires a new **mental model**. Instead of thinking in terms of centralized logic, storage, and identity, think in terms of **decentralized contracts**, **public state**, and **user-owned keys**.

By leaving behind these Web2 patterns and embracing Web3-native architecture, you’ll build apps on XION that are secure, trustless, and truly user-centric.
