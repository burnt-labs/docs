# Web3 for Web2 Developers

It can be a challenge coming from a pure Web2 background to fully understand how to build on a Web3 infrastructure like XION. Building on Web3 requires a mindset shift. While the core principles of software development still apply, the architecture, tooling, and user interaction models are different. This guide will help you bridge the gap.



## The Key Differences Between Web2 and Web3

You'll start by understanding the fundamental architectural differences between Web2 and Web3 applications:

* **Backend vs Smart Contracts**: In Web2, your backend logic typically lives in frameworks like Laravel or Express. In Web3, this logic is deployed on-chain via smart contracts.
* **Databases vs On-chain State**: Instead of using MySQL or MongoDB, data in Web3 lives within the smart contract’s storage which is public and immutable.
* **Centralized Auth vs Wallet-based Auth**: Authentication moves away from traditional login systems to decentralized wallet-based identity using cryptographic signatures.



## The XION Architecture

Next, you’ll explore how dapps are built specifically on the XION blockchain, and what makes the platform unique:

* You'll get an overview of the full-stack architecture used by most XION-based applications.
* You'll learn the role of **CosmWasm smart contracts**, which serve as the core logic layer for your dapp.
* We’ll show you how XION encourages a **frontend-first approach**, enabling developers to use tools like the `abstraxion` library for seamless wallet interaction from the UI.
