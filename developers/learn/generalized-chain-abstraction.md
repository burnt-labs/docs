# Generalized Chain Abstraction

## **What is Chain Abstraction?**

Chain Abstraction is the process of removing complexities and technicalities that interfere with user experiences while maintaining the broader benefits of decentralized technology.

XION is a layer-1 blockchain purpose-built to abstract away the complexities of Web3 technology. It was developed with Chain Abstraction at its core, with every element of its infrastructure designed to address the functional & cultural barriers prevalent in Web3 technology. As a result, XION is the first blockchain to enable versatile products and applications to flourish among non crypto-native audiences.



## How does it achieve this through Generalized Chain Abstraction?

XION employs an all-encompassing solution for Chain Abstraction to be effective in solving adoption challenges. There are a myriad of complexities and technicalities in the current Web3 ecosystem that need to be abstracted away. Incremental solutions – such as adding the ability for a user to login with their email – might simplify one step of the user onboarding process, but if the user is then met with 15 additional steps to understand and manage gas fees, acquire tokens, grasp the inherent value of those tokens, and more, then the initial simplicity becomes moot.&#x20;

The robustness of XION’s all-encompassing Chain Abstraction solution is highlighted below through multiple distinct facets, each addressing specific pain points. Its foundation is built upon the seamless integration of complex blockchain functionalities – such as accounts, signatures, fees, and interoperability – directly at the protocol level. In doing so, XION eliminates significant barriers to entry for new users, while circumventing fragmentation challenges that developers encounter in other ecosystems. In addition, through its modular design, XION is designed to enable many more future extensions.&#x20;



## Key Highlights

* Generalized Abstraction: An infrastructure solution designed to abstract away all complexities and solve the key challenges that have hindered widespread adoption of the blockchain industry, through protocol-level implementations.
* Meta Accounts: XION’s protocol-level abstracted accounts decouple the conventional private-public key model, enabling intuitive user experiences traditional in Web2. These include diverse authentication methods, key rotation, account recovery, cross-device usage, and more.
* Signature Abstraction: XION’s signature-agnostic Meta Accounts enable users to easily onboard onto XION apps using familiar Web2 methods such as email, biometrics, and essentially any cryptographic signature scheme. While users no longer have to install Metamask or other crypto wallets, these are supported as well, allowing XION to cater to all audiences.
* Device Abstraction: By removing the need for users to directly manage private keys, users are able to interact with applications seamlessly across devices, enhancing both accessibility and security.
* Parameterized Fee Layer: A novel approach to fee handling on the network enabling the abstraction of gas fees from the end-user perspective, the ability for XION to be denominated fully in USDC, and any token to be accepted for transactions throughout the network.
* Abstracted Interoperability: A solution extending XION’s Meta Account functionalities to be interoperable across all connected ecosystems, enhancing the cross-chain user experience significantly.

## **Generalized Abstraction Use-Cases**

XION’s Generalized Abstraction layer enables both vastly enhanced user experiences for existing applications, as well as enabling a range of novel ones. Below are a few non-exhaustive examples of use-cases made possible by Generalized Abstraction on XION. We also provide additional examples of applications able to leverage abstracted interoperability to enable innovative cross-chain use cases.

<details>

<summary>Global Messenger &#x26; Venmo App</summary>

A decentralized messaging service leverages generalized abstraction to enable users to safely access their messaging chats seamlessly with the same account, whether they're using a smartphone, tablet, or desktop. Users are able to remit funds globally, sending assets cross-border through gasless transactions directly within the messaging app.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Digital Banking App</summary>

A digital banking application leverages generalized abstraction to allow customers to set temporary session keys for limited-time access, ensuring higher security for transactions while allowing the users to also define their own transaction limits and conditions. These users can also set up multiple authentication method requirements for large transactions, as well as the ability to recover account information should they lose access to certain authentication methods.

<details>

<summary>Creator Economy App</summary>

A decentralized content streaming service leverages generalized abstraction to create subscription-based accounts, where users are automatically charged monthly through smart contract triggers without needing manual renewals. Creators and their fans of all ages are able to frictionlessly create these accounts, and access the content from all their devices.

<details>

<summary>Gaming App</summary>

An on-chain game leverages generalized abstraction to enable the seamless use of session keys, batching of transactions, and gasless transactions to enable smooth and secure gameplay without endangering the user’s assets, all while reducing latency.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Web2 DAO</summary>

An online collaborative platform leverages generalized abstraction to set up decentralized organizations where members have different permission levels, enabling non-technical users to participate in governance or decision-making processes through intuitive, familiar Web2 interfaces.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Cloud Storage App </summary>

A decentralized cloud storage platform leverages generalized abstraction to enable a family to seamlessly access their content across multiple devices. Through the use of account permissions, family members have different levels of access and editing privileges.
