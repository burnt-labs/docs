# SubQuery

SubQuery is a leading blockchain data indexer that offers developers fast, flexible, open-source, and decentralized APIs for web3 projects. With the SubQuery SDK, developers can efficiently access rich indexed data to build intuitive and immersive decentralized applications. SubQuery supports a wide range of ecosystems, including XION, Cosmos, Ethereum, Polygon, Polkadot, Algorand, NEAR,  Avalanche among others.

A key advantage of SubQuery is its ability to aggregate data across multiple blockchains within a single project. This enables developers to create advanced dashboard analytics, multi-chain block scanners, and index IBC transactions across zones.

## Running and Hosting your XION SubQuery APIs

SubQuery is open-source, meaning you have the freedom to run it in the following ways:

* Locally on your own computer (or a cloud provider of your choosing), [view the instructions on how to run SubQuery Locally](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/run.html).
* You can publish it to SubQuery's enterprise-level [Managed Service](https://managedservice.subquery.network/), where we'll host your SubQuery project in production ready services for mission critical data with zero-downtime blue/green deployments. There even is a generous free tier.
* You can publish it to the decentralised [SubQuery Network](https://academy.subquery.network/subquery_network/architects/publish.html#deploying-your-project), the most open, performant, reliable, and scalable data service for dApp developers. The SubQuery Network indexes and services data to the global community in an incentivised and verifiable way and supports XION from launch.
