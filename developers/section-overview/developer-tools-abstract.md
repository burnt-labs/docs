# Developer Tools: Abstract

Abstract is an application development platform specially built for applications that are chain-agnostic (or abstracted üòâ). The best place to read more about Abstract would be their documentation at:

{% embed url="https://docs.abstract.money" %}
Abstract Money Documentation
{% endembed %}

In this page we will be introducing the tools provided by Abstracted that can help you speedrun through development on Xion

{% hint style="success" %}
If you‚Äôre a brand new dev, Abstract infrastructure may be overwhelming to start with, so we recommend just checking out the [CosmWasm documentation](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/core) and starting with the basic [CosmWasm template](https://github.com/AbstractSDK/cw-template).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Smart contracts = Modules** (in Abstract lingo)
{% endhint %}

## Contracts: Build and Deploy

Abstract provides tools to build a re-usable or a standalone contract. Re-usable contracts are also referred as "Modules".

### Bootstrap Codebase: Abstract Module Template

> The Abstract Module Template is a starting point for developing composable smart-contracts, or "Modules" on the Abstract platform. To learn more about Abstract Accounts, please see the [abstract accounts documentation](https://docs.abstract.money/3_framework/3_architecture.html). To read more about modules, please see the [module documentation](https://docs.abstract.money/3_framework/6_module_types.html).

Spin up a new project using:

```bash
cargo generate --git https://github.com/AbstractSDK/templates.git
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Refer the [repository](https://github.com/AbstractSDK/templates) for latest updates and instructions on spinning up. This documentation and the repository's updates might go out of sync.
{% endhint %}

### Test contracts: CW-Orchestrator

> cw-orchestrator is an advanced testing and deployment tool for CosmWasm smart-contracts. It‚Äôs designed to make it easy to test and deploy contracts in a variety of environments including cw-multi-test, local, testnet, and mainnet.&#x20;
>
> [Read more here](https://orchestrator.abstract.money/)

If you bootstrap the codebase using the Abstract module template mentioned above you should have cw-orchestrator setu up already.&#x20;

### Generate Schemas: \``just schema`\`

`just` is a command line tool to manage and execute project specific commands. A project bootstrapped using Abstract Module Template (above) comes with handy `just` commands defined. eg., `just schema` will generate schema files in the project (should be executed if any changes are made to messages and responses)

See `/justfile` in project root for all commands

## Client

Abstract's JS SDK works well with both Xion's meta-accounts and EOAs.&#x20;

Abstract provides templates to build and debug using regular EOAs on the Xion chain. However in production environment we highly recommend using meta-accounts to be able to leverage the true power of the chain and UX :)&#x20;

#### Documentation:

Abstract's Javascript / Typescript SDK Documentation

The [app templates repo](https://github.com/AbstractSDK/templates) includes a frontend folder scaffolded with React, next.js, and graz as the Cosmos wallet connector.

#### Example Frontend

An example frontend of a betting app deployed on XION can be found here: [https://github.com/AbstractSDK/abstract.js/tree/believathon/examples/wagemos-xion-nextjs](https://github.com/AbstractSDK/abstract.js/tree/believathon/examples/wagemos-xion-nextjs)

**Notes:**

* This example has a ‚Äúdev mode‚Äù which uses EOAs as the executor using `grazProvider`. This should be used when developing the application else you will run into permissions errors.
* The example also demonstrates a ‚Äúuser mode‚Äù using the XION modal. We recommend having separate `AbstractProvider`s for developer and user routes.

## Client <> Contract

1. Codegen
   1. When your contract devs have defined the messages for your contracts, run `just schema` to make the schemas available for codegen.
   2. Ensure that the `abstract.config.js` is configured with the proper folders
   3. Run `abstract generate` (CLI docs [here](https://js.abstract.money/cli/introduction)).
2. Use the generated code (`src/_generated`) to interact with your app. There is already an example for use of `cw20` contract. Refer the `wagemos` examples: [https://github.com/AbstractSDK/abstract.js/tree/believathon/examples](https://github.com/AbstractSDK/abstract.js/tree/believathon/examples)
3. Use the autogenerated module code to interact with the contracts

## Debugging

1. Get ready to publish
   1. Add a seed phrase in the `TEST_MNEMONIC` in `.env`
      1. This can be from Keplr or another Cosmos Wallet. Add XION [here](https://explorer.burnt.com/wallet/suggest) or by connecting to the [Abstract Console](https://believathon.console.abstract.money/).
   2. Ensure that you have funds in the address. On testnet, new XION Meta accounts all have 1 XION so sign-in [to the XION dashboard](https://testnet.dashboard.burnt.com) and send funds to this address.
2. Publish your contract onchain with `just publish`
   1. This will create a new Abstract Account, claim the namespace (configured in your app), and publish the contracts on-chain to the [contract registry](https://believathon.console.abstract.money/modules).
3. Publish your schemas with `just publish-schemas <namespace> <name> <version>` . This will give your contract auto-generated UIs in the Console.
