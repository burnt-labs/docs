# CosmWasm Resources

### What is CosmWasm?

CosmWasm is a smart contract platform written as a module that can be integrated into any blockchain built on top of the Cosmos SDK.&#x20;

Currently, Rust is the most used programming language for CosmWasm. In the future, other programming languages, such as Go Lang, may also be utilized in some instances.

### Sections <a href="#sections" id="sections"></a>

* Introduction

This section provides hands-on training, guiding you through modifying, deploying, and executing a smart contract on a blockchain. It is the ideal place to familiarize yourself with all aspects of the system without delving too deep into coding.

* Contract Semantics

This section explains much of the high-level design and architecture of CosmWasm. It is crucial to understand the mental model and capabilities of the system before designing products with it. However, if you prefer to learn through coding, you can skip this section and revisit it as needed.

* Architecture

&#x20;This section explores the various components that make up smart contracts and how they interact with the wider CosmWasm environment.

* Tutorials&#x20;

This section demonstrates the development of smart contracts from zero to production with step-by-step explanations, code snippets, scripts, and more.
