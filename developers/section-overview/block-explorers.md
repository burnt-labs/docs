# Block Explorers

Block explorers provide a user-friendly interface to view detailed information about blocks, transactions, accounts, and other on-chain data. The XION network is supported by multiple community-operated explorers, helping developers, validators, and end-users track on-chain activity.

We maintain a list of recommended block explorers for both **mainnet** and **testnet** in the [Cosmos chain registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry).

* **Mainnet Explorers**\
  [XION Mainnet explorer in the chain registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/blob/master/xion/chain.json#L226-L257)
* **Testnet Explorers**\
  [XION Testnet explorers in the chain registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/blob/master/testnets/xiontestnet/chain.json#L184-L202)

### How to Add or Update Explorers

If you operate a block explorer or notice outdated explorer information, please consider opening a Pull Request (PR) in the [Cosmos chain registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry). You can update or add explorers by modifying the relevant XION files:

* [Mainnet `xion/chain.json`](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/blob/master/xion/chain.json)
* [Testnet `xiontestnet/chain.json`](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/blob/master/testnets/xiontestnet/chain.json)

For more details on how to submit a PR or update existing entries, refer to the [Cosmos chain registry guidelines](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry#contributing).
