# Block Explorers

Block explorers provide a user-friendly interface to view detailed information about blocks, transactions, accounts, and other on-chain data. The XION network is supported by multiple community-operated explorers, helping developers, validators, and end-users track on-chain activity.

We maintain a list of recommended block explorers for both **mainnet** and **testnet** in the [Cosmos chain registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry).
