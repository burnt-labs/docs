# Introductory Section&#x20;

The introductory section provides an overview of the core principles behind CosmWasm Smart Contracts. While a basic familiarity with Rust could be beneficial, the material is designed to cater to individuals of all proficiency levels, irrespective of their prior experience. Our goal is to offer clear and accessible guidance, allowing newcomers to gain practical insights through a comprehensive, step-by-step tutorial that delves into the following subjects:

* Setting up environment
* Deploying a smart contract to the XION blockchain
* Executing smart contract functions via the CLI
* Modifying an existing contract

If you'd like to start your exploration by delving into the inner workings of CosmWasm, you're welcome to skip ahead to the Architecture section for a concise overview. Later, you can return to this section to continue your journey.

You might have observed that the development of smart contracts is not covered in this section. The Getting Started segment has been purposely crafted to be as straightforward as possible, sidestepping any potential complexities associated with smart contract development, which will be covered in subsequent sections.

### Descriptions of the Following Sections:

[Setting up Environment](setting-up-environment.md): This section guides you through the setup of your client environment, essential software tools, and how to interact with the faucet.

[Compiling a Contract](compiling-a-contract.md): This section provides a step-by-step walkthrough of downloading and compiling smart contract code into wasm bytecode.

[Unit Test](unit-test.md): In this section, you'll learn how to perform unit tests within a CosmWasm smart contract, ensuring its functionality.

[Deployment and Interaction](deployment-and-interaction/): This section demonstrates the deployment of a contract to the testnet, instantiation, and the execution of smart contract functions.

[Next Steps](next-steps.md): The concluding part of this tutorial, Next Steps, summarizes the Getting Started section and directs you towards further learning resources.
