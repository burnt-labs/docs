# Interact with XION chain: Setup XION Daemon

The XION Daemon binary is the primary interaction point for a DAPP developer to the XION blockchain both locally and on testnet.

## Installation

1. Clone the [Xion](https://github.com/burnt-labs/xion) repository locally.
2. Run `make install` in the above directory
3. The \`xiond\` command will be installed into your $GOPATH

{% hint style="warning" %}
$GOPATH/bin must be on your $PATH for this to work. You can do this by adding the following to your .zshrc or .bashrc file.

```bash
export GOPATH=$(go env GOPATH)
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH
```
{% endhint %}

For more information see [here](../../../nodes-and-validators/run-a-node/build-the-xion-daemon.md).

### Alternative Installation - Homebrew

## Common use case for the CLI (Locally)

### Listing keys available to the cli

```bash
$ xiond keys list
```

Output

```bash

- address: xion1e2fuwe3uhq8zd9nkkk876nawrwdulgv460vzg7
  name: local-testnet-faucet
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"Ayrlj6q3WWs91p45LVKwI8JyfMYNmWMrcDinLNEdWYE4"}'
  type: local
- address: xion1h495zmkgm92664jfnc80n9p64xs5xf56qrg4vc
  name: local-testnet-validator
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AiBl5S4fP+Ra2LD/EZ2XtWwNu9otOCFMTs8tfq5fwIXm"}'
  type: local
```

The `name` field is an alias that can be used in some other commands.

### Checking an account balance

```bash
$ xiond query bank balances <address>
```

Output:

```bash

- amount: "10000000000000"
  denom: uxion
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

### Send Xion tokens to another address

To send xion to another address&#x20;

```bash
$ xiond tx bank send <sender address> <receiver address> <amount>
```

The sender must be an address in the list of keys shown above and the amount must be have a denomination such like \`100uxion\`.

```

  fee:
    amount: []
    gas_limit: "200000"
    granter: ""
    payer: ""
  signer_infos: []
  tip: null
body:
  extension_options: []
  memo: ""
  messages:
