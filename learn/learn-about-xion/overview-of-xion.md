# Overview of XION

## Intro

XION is the first layer one blockchain purpose built for consumer adoption by enabling seamless user experiences for everyday users through chain abstraction.



XION’s Generalized Chain Abstraction includes protocol-level abstractions across Accounts, Signatures, Gas, Interoperability, Pricing, Devices, Payments, and more. By abstracting away all crypto complexities, XION allows the development of next-generation projects bringing Web3 to mainstream audiences worldwide.

## **Generalized Chain Abstraction Layer 1 Chain**

* Generalized Abstraction: unique protocol-level abstraction that spans Accounts, Signatures, Payments, Pricing, Interoperability, Devices, Gas, and more to make Web3 accessible to everyone, everywhere.
  * Account Abstraction — XION pioneers modular account abstraction at the protocol level.
  * Signature Abstraction — XION is the first chain to support signing across all current and future cryptographic curves, through complete Signature Abstraction.. This enables the signing of transactions using email, biometrics (FaceID, Passkeys, etc.), EVM curve, Solana curve, and more
  * Gas Abstraction — XION eliminates the concept of gas fees entirely for the end user
  * Pricing Abstraction — XION is the first chain to utilize familiar fiat denominated pricing, also eliminating asset volatility
  * Abstracted Interoperability — XION is able to extend its Chain Abstraction solution to enable true interoperability across ecosystems.
  * Device Abstraction — XION provides safe and efficient operations across various devices through its Meta Accounts & signature abstraction, fully abstracting away the concept of wallet plugins or apps
  * Payment Abstraction — XION streamlines payments by eradicating the traditional purchasing complexities through its unique fee abstraction, enabling users to transact with any token of choice as well as direct credit and debit card transactions
* XION’s infrastructure allows the development of next-generation mass-market projects through unparalleled user-friendly experiences. This is made possible by its Meta Accounts, seamless device support, lightning-fast gasless transactions, extremely low fees, native on & off ramps, global direct credit/debit card purchasing, familiar fiat denomination, interoperability with 50+ other networks, and more.
  * XION’s L1 abstracts away all crypto complexities for users to enable mass adoption
