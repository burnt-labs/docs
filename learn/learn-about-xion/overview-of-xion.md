## What is Xion?

XION is a Blockchain that is purpose-built for user experience.

### How is user-experience at the centre of the tech?

Complex functionalities such as accounts, signatures, fee management, and interoperability are baked into the protocol. This is also referred to as Generalized Abstraction Layer. Other features that sets XION apart are:

1. Generalized chain abstraction
2. Meta-Accounts
3. Signature Device Abstraction
4. Parameterized Fee Layer
5. Abstracted Interoperability

We'll go over what these features mean in detail in later sections but below you can find a general overview:

## **Generalized Chain Abstraction Layer 1 Chain**

* Generalized Abstraction: unique protocol-level abstraction that spans Accounts, Signatures, Payments, Pricing, Interoperability, Devices, Gas, and more to make Web3 accessible to everyone, everywhere.
  * Account Abstraction — XION pioneers modular account abstraction at the protocol level.
  * Signature Abstraction — XION is the first chain to support signing across all current and future cryptographic curves, through complete Signature Abstraction.. This enables the signing of transactions using email, biometrics (FaceID, Passkeys, etc.), EVM curve, Solana curve, and more
  * Gas Abstraction — XION eliminates the concept of gas fees entirely for the end user
  * Pricing Abstraction — XION is the first chain to utilize familiar fiat denominated pricing, also eliminating asset volatility
  * Abstracted Interoperability — XION is able to extend its Chain Abstraction solution to enable true interoperability across ecosystems.
  * Device Abstraction — XION provides safe and efficient operations across various devices through its Meta Accounts & signature abstraction, fully abstracting away the concept of wallet plugins or apps
  * Payment Abstraction — XION streamlines payments by eradicating the traditional purchasing complexities through its unique fee abstraction, enabling users to transact with any token of choice as well as direct credit and debit card transactions

## Meta-Accounts

The protocol-level implementation of meta accounts allows for more intuitive user interfaces by decoupling the traditional private-public key model. This enables users to interact with their accounts using familiar methods like email or biometric authentication, enhancing security and ease of use

## Signature Device Abstraction

XION's signature abstraction supports various cryptographic curves, ensuring compatibility and adaptability to future developments. Device abstraction allows users to access their accounts seamlessly across multiple devices without managing private keys, thus reducing complexity and risk

## Parameterized Fee Layer

XION's approach to transaction fees includes global fee abstraction, allowing the use of any token for fees, and a new fee type called PlatformSend. This enables gasless experiences for users and supports token-agnostic payments

## Abstracted Interoperability

XION enhances cross-chain user experiences through abstracted interoperability, allowing users to perform actions on any connected chain from a central account. This addresses account fragmentation issues in multichain environment
