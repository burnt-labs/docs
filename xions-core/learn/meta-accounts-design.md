# Meta Accounts Design

**Overview**

XIONâ€™s modular _meta accounts_ introduce a highly adaptable and secure account creation & management framework.

Built at the protocol-level, _meta accounts_ have a host of benefits over traditional crypto wallets and enable novel Web3 application use-cases. See [generalized-chain-abstraction.md](generalized-chain-abstraction.md "mention") for more information around use cases and features.
