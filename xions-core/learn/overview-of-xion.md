# XION Overview

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/XION Infrastructure Graphic Chain Abstraction 2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## What is Xion?

XION is a blockchain designed for seamless user experience, integrating key functionalities directly at the protocol level. By abstracting complexities like accounts, signatures, fees, and interoperability, XION makes Web3 more accessible to everyone.

### Why is XION Built for User Experience?

XION introduces **Generalized Abstraction**, embedding critical blockchain functionalities into its core protocol. This eliminates the need for complex third-party solutions, creating a frictionless experience for both developers and users.

Key innovations that set XION apart include:

* [**Generalized Chain Abstraction**](generalized-chain-abstraction.md) – A unified protocol layer simplifying blockchain interactions.
* [**Meta-Accounts**](xions-meta-accounts.md) – Eliminating private key dependencies for easier access.
* **Signature Device Abstraction** – Enabling multiple authentication methods, from email to biometrics.
* **Parameterized Fee Layer** – Allowing flexible fee payments and gasless transactions.
* **Abstracted Interoperability** – Enabling seamless multichain interactions from a single account.
